# Data Sources

Three stores, each with exactly one owner. Keeping them separate is what lets the page be editable
without `.management/` becoming a rival source of truth for the plan.

| Store | Holds | Owner | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.idea/` | Intent — epics, phases, acceptance criteria | The plan | `/shape` |
| `state.json` | Derived structure — tasks, their phase and epic | Regenerated wholesale | `/setup` |
| `board.db` | **Authored data** — assignees, estimates, actuals, points, links, test runs | People | This page, and sync |

`board.db` is owned by the dashboard alone. It never holds task *text* or structure — only what
people record *about* a task. Tables in [[Database Schema]].

## The join key: task reference ID

Every task carries a stable id like `TSK-7F3A21`, written into the epic note as an Obsidian block
reference on its acceptance-criteria line:

```markdown
- [ ] A document survives a restart ^tsk-7f3a21
```

`/shape` assigns it once, when the criterion is first written, and never reassigns it. It survives
rewording, reordering, and regeneration — which is precisely why authored data can hang off it.
`state.json` carries it, `board.db` keys on it, and the drawer displays it.

The id is displayed uppercase (`TSK-7F3A21`) and stored lowercase in the block reference, because
Obsidian block refs are lowercase by convention. Compare case-insensitively.

> [!warning] Never match on task text
> If a task has no id, show the card with a muted `no id` and disable its editing. Do not invent an
> id, and never fall back to matching on text — a reworded task would silently inherit another
> task's assignees, time, and PR.

## Two kinds of task

Structure is derived, with one deliberate exception: tasks created on the board. They live only in
`board.db` with `origin = 'authored'` and an `ADH-` id, are marked as ad-hoc in the UI, and are
invisible to `/shape` and `/setup` until promoted into their epic. [[Board]] covers the flow and why
the distinction is not cosmetic.

Sprints, team members, and their contribution are authored in full — `.idea/` has phases, not
sprints, and no opinion about people. See [[Sprints]] and [[Team]].

## Commits as evidence

Git hooks record every commit into `board.db` and `.management/commits.jsonl`, linking it to any
task ids in the message. Hooks are shell scripts: they write data, **never vault Markdown**, since
they cannot go through the Obsidian MCP.

A commit is evidence that work happened. It never marks a task done — completion comes from a
verified exit criterion. Commits referencing no task become the *untracked* rows in the delivery
log, so unplanned work is still counted. See `.claude/skills/setup/references/git-hooks.md`.

## Sync, not live fetch

PR status and test results come from outside the project. **The page never fetches them.** Claude
writes them into `board.db` during `/setup` or an explicit refresh; the page reads only the database.

This is not a stylistic preference. A browser page cannot call an MCP server — MCP tools run on
Claude's side — so any design where the page fetches PR status simply cannot work.

Consequences the UI must honour:

- Every externally sourced row carries `synced_at`.
- The page displays that timestamp wherever it shows synced data.
- Stale is shown as stale. Never present an old status as though it were current.
- A failed or skipped sync leaves the previous value in place, with its original timestamp.

## What regeneration may and may not touch

When `/setup` regenerates:

- **Rewritten:** `state.json` and the derived sections of the Markdown files.
- **Never touched:** every row in `board.db`. Regeneration must not clear an assignee or a logged
  hour.
- **Orphans:** if a task id disappears from `.idea/` — its criterion was deleted — its `board.db`
  rows are kept and marked orphaned, not deleted. Report them so a person decides. Data a human
  typed is never destroyed by an automated regeneration.
