description: Set up the development environment and build the current roadmap phase, driven by .idea/SPECS.md and .idea/ROADMAP.md. Use when the user wants to start the project, scaffold the codebase, set up the dev environment, initialise the stack, or build the next phase. Checks .idea/ for context first and routes to shape or brainstorm if the spec is missing.

# Setup

Turn `.idea/SPECS.md` into a working repository, one roadmap phase at a time.

**Plain language.** Everything you say to the person — questions, plans, summaries, reports —
follows `.claude/skills/shared/plain-language.md`: assume they are not a developer, use simple
words, recommend an option when you ask, and explain any technical word the first time it appears.
Notes in `.idea/` may stay technical; explain them, don't paste them.

> [!important] Application code lives in `app/`
> The repository root belongs to the workflow — `.idea/`, `.management/`, `.claude/`, and the
> project's own `README.md`. Everything you scaffold goes in **`app/`**: the manifest, the source
> tree, the lockfile, the test config, the build output.
>
> This keeps the product and the workflow from colliding. A clone can be built in without
> overwriting the boilerplate's own documentation, `.idea/` stays at the root where every skill
> expects it, and "what is the project" never becomes ambiguous. A monorepo later adds
> `app/`-siblings; it does not move `app/`.
Read `.claude/skills/shared/vault-contract.md` before writing anything to `.idea/`, and
`.claude/skills/shared/quality-bar.md` before any structural or technology decision — including the
ones `SPECS.md` left open and the ones a scaffolder makes on your behalf.

**Write no project code before Phase 3 of this skill is confirmed.**

## Phase 1 — Read `.idea/` first. Always. Before anything else.

1. `ls -R .idea/ 2>/dev/null`.
2. Route on what is there:

| State | Action |
|---|---|
| `SPECS.md` **and** `ROADMAP.md` exist | Read both in full, plus every epic in the target phase and the idea notes those epics cite. → Phase 2. |
| `SPECS.md` but no `ROADMAP.md` | Read it, build from the v1 scope, and offer `/shape` to phase the rest properly. |
| `.idea/` with notes but no `SPECS.md` | **Run the `shape` skill's flow** — that is where the spec-writing interview lives. Do not duplicate it here. Return when SPECS.md is signed off. |
| No `.idea/` at all, or nearly empty | Say so and offer `/brainstorm`. If the user wants to skip straight to code, run the shape interview to produce a minimal SPECS.md first — never scaffold from an unrecorded stack decision. |

3. Read the repo for signals that **override** the spec: existing lockfile, `package.json`,
   `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Dockerfile`, CI config, `.env.example`. Look in
   **`app/`** first, then the root — a project set up by an earlier run keeps all of these in
   `app/`. A lockfile on disk beats a spec table. On genuine conflict, ask — never silently pick
   one.

## Phase 2 — Pick the phase

Report where the roadmap stands and name the target phase — the lowest-numbered one that is neither
`verified` nor `done`. If there is none, the roadmap is complete: say so and offer `/ship` for any
phase still at `verified`, `/epic` for new work, or `/maintain`. **First read any unconsumed `phase_advance` rows in `board.db`**: an advance
made on the dashboard moves the effective phase before `ROADMAP.md` knows it, and building the phase
the user already left (parked work included) is the wrong build. Target the phase they imply, and
apply them properly in Phase 6. Phases move `planned → in-progress → verified → done`: **`/setup` sets
`verified`** when every exit criterion it can check is met; **only `/ship` sets `done`**, after the
release is live. Criteria that only a real release can prove — "deployed and reachable", the
performance budget "on the real target" — stay open at `verified` and are ticked by `/ship`. That is
how Phase 0's walking skeleton gets deployed: its first `/ship`.

If a lower phase is `verified` but not yet `done`, say so before building the next one, and ask.
Phase 0 especially: building features on a skeleton that never reached the real target postpones
exactly the risk Phase 0 exists to retire.
State its Goal, Exit criteria and Non-goals back to the user, and confirm that is the target.

First run always includes the Phase 0 walking skeleton, even if the user asks to jump ahead:
the skeleton is what makes later phases safe. Say why if you have to override an ask.

## Phase 3 — Plan, then confirm

**Show the person a plain summary first**: what you are about to set up, in a few short lines, what
it will cost them (money, accounts to create, time), and anything you need from them. The full
technical list below follows it, for the record, clearly marked as detail they do not need to read
to say yes.

Produce a concrete ordered list of exactly what you will create and run: scaffolder invocation,
dependencies, directory tree, config files, env files, database setup, scripts, CI, git hooks, docs,
and the `.management/` tracker. Every path in that list is under `app/`, except `.management/`,
`.claude/` (including the `.claude/team/` stack profile), and the root `README.md`.

Structure is a decision, not a default. Per `quality-bar.md`, state your reasoning for the module
boundaries, the data-access approach, and the rendering or data-fetching strategy — including where
you are keeping what the scaffolder generated and where you are overriding it. Where a choice
resolves toward quality at a visible cost in setup effort or added concepts, say so in this list so
the user can disagree before you execute rather than after.

Flag anything that touches the network, installs globally, or creates cloud resources.
**Get explicit confirmation before executing.**

## Phase 4 — Execute

Load `references/execution.md` and follow its order. In short: scaffold with the ecosystem's own
tool → dependencies → config → env → database → scripts → tests → CI → **git hooks** → docs →
verify → git.

The commit-tracking hooks are not optional: they are what keeps `.management/` honest between runs.
See `references/git-hooks.md`.

**Neither is the test setup.** A runner, at least one test that asserts something real, and the
checks wired into CI and the `pre-push` hook go in on the *first* run, before any feature exists —
not when the project is big enough to feel like it needs them. A project that reaches its second
phase untested never retrofits them, and every later phase's exit criteria then rest on nothing.

Set up, in this order and always:

- **A unit runner** for the ecosystem, with one test that asserts real behaviour.
- **A browser or integration runner** wherever the product has behaviour a unit test cannot reach —
  offline, persistence, a migration, a real request. Say so plainly if the product genuinely has
  none.
- **CI** running install → lint → typecheck → test → build on every push.
- **`pre-push`** running the same checks locally, blocking a red push.
- **Test results recorded against tasks**, per Phase 6 below.

Non-negotiables:
- Never fabricate a version number or CLI flag. Verify, or let the official scaffolder decide.
- Never invent or commit a secret. `.env.example` documents keys with empty values.
- Never overwrite a file without reading it first and telling the user.
- Build only the target phase. An epic from Phase 3 is out of scope in Phase 1, however tempting.

## Phase 5 — Verify honestly

Actually run install, lint, typecheck, test, and build, and show the real output. Then walk the
target phase's **Exit criteria** one at a time and mark each met or not met with the evidence.

**Measure the `SPECS.md` performance budget and report the real numbers**, against the target device
and network it names. On Phase 0 this is what converts the stack from a belief into a fact; on later
phases it catches the drift that makes a project slow one commit at a time. A missed budget is
reported as missed — fix it, or record it as an accepted regression with a reason. Never round it,
and never omit it because the phase was otherwise green.

If something fails: fix it. If you cannot, say so plainly and leave the criterion unmet. A phase
reported as complete with a failing check is worse than an honest partial.

## Phase 6 — Project management

Run this phase on **every** run, green or not — "tracking starts on day one" includes the day the
checks failed. A red run still ingests commits, records the failing test runs and recomputes
readiness; it simply marks nothing done. Only the dashboard build, at the end, waits for green.

Stand up or refresh `.management/` — the execution tracker.
Load `references/management.md` for the layout, templates, and the `state.json` schema.

It is **derived from `.idea/`**, never a second source of truth. `.idea/` holds intent (what and
why); `.management/` holds state (progress, blockers, dates, what shipped). Create it on the first
run; refresh it on every later run.

1. **Ingest commits first.** The record is `git log --all` itself — every commit, including pulled
   ones, squash-merges from GitHub and a teammate's work — minus tateru's own history, which every
   clone carries. Read it through one script, which excludes tateru's tags and branches whatever
   the remote is called, and works from any directory:

   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/project-log.sh --format='%H %an %s'
   ```

   Read it whole on every run; it is cheap, and a resume point would break on the first rebase.
   `.claude/TATERU_BASE` is the commit the project started from, written by the first run's Git
   step. **If it is missing** (the script exits 2 — a project set up at 0.1.0 or earlier), write it
   now: `git fetch <up> --no-tags` (and `git config remote.<up>.tagOpt --no-tags`), then
   `git merge-base HEAD <up>/main`; with no tateru remote,
   ask. Parse task ids from each message the way
   the `post-commit` hook does (`TSK-` and `ADH-` ids, case-insensitive). `.management/commits.jsonl`
   is a local cache of this machine's commits, useful for timing, never the whole record. Map commits to tasks by reference id; a commit is
   evidence, never completion. Commits referencing no task are recorded as untracked work, so
   unplanned effort is not lost.
2. Read `.idea/ROADMAP.md` and every `.idea/epics/*.md`. **Skip epics at `status: suggested` or
   `cut`** —
   the `project-manager` agent's proposals count toward nothing until a person accepts one with
   `/epic accept` (vault contract), and a cut one was rejected. List suggestions in the run report as
   awaiting a decision instead, and never report either kind's missing points as gaps.
3. Derive tasks from the remaining epics' acceptance criteria. Never invent a task with no epic behind it, and never
   quietly drop one — an epic with no criteria is a gap, so report it.

   **Carry each criterion's `(N pts)` into `state.json` as the task's points.** A task must never
   reach the board unpointed: assignee capacity is the sum of points on their open tasks, and one
   missing value makes every capacity figure a lie of unknown size. An epic whose criteria lack
   points is a gap in `.idea/` — report it and offer `/shape` to fix it, rather than defaulting the
   number here and hiding the omission.
4. Write `BOARD.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `BLOCKERS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `state.json`. **Leave
   `.management/README.md` alone**: it ships with tateru, explains the folder, and `/upgrade` keeps
   it current.
   Carry each task's reference id (`^tsk-`) through into `state.json`; a task without one cannot
   hold assignees or effort.
5. Mark done only what Phase 5 actually verified. Progress you cannot evidence is fiction.
6. Preserve hand-written notes in `BLOCKERS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`; rewrite only derived sections.
7. **Create or migrate `board.db`** per `.management/design/Database Schema.md` — whether or not the
   dashboard is built. The test trail, assignees and the `project-manager` agent's task updates all
   live there, so a deferred dashboard must not mean an untracked project. Use the `sqlite3` CLI, or
   the app's own SQLite driver where the CLI is missing (Git Bash on Windows does not ship it). If
   neither exists, say so plainly; the Markdown tracking still works. Then sync pull request and
   test data into it.

   **`board.db` is one person's board.** It is gitignored because it holds names, and it is a binary
   file git cannot merge, so it is not shared between clones. Say so once, on the first run, if the
   same commit range shows more than one author: in a team, one person runs
   `/setup` and holds the board.

   **Never** clear a row a person authored: a task id that has left `.idea/` is marked orphaned, not
   deleted.
8. **Apply any phase advance recorded on the dashboard.** Read `phase_advance` in `board.db`. For
   each row not yet consumed, record the advance in `ROADMAP.md`, open the next phase, and stamp
   `consumed_at` so it is applied once. Either kind of advance sets the phase `verified` — `/ship`
   still owns `done`. A **forced** advance (`forced = 1`) also never reads as a finished phase:
   write a `> [!warning] Advanced on <date> with N exit criteria unmet` callout in its section and
   leave each unmet criterion as `- [ ] <text> — unmet at advance <date>`, which `/ship`'s Exit
   criteria gate then reports. Leave criteria ending ` — at release` exactly as they are: they are
   `/ship`'s to prove, and are not unmet work. Write `state.json` `currentPhase` as the lowest phase that is neither
   `verified` nor `done` — or the last phase, once every phase is — so the dashboard does not fall back once the row is consumed.

   Carry the **parked** items into the record rather than dropping them: a criterion in
   `criterion_park` is written into `ROADMAP.md` as `- [~] <text>`, its text unchanged — the park is
   keyed on that text — with `  Parked <date>.` on the next line; `[~]` goes into `state.json` as
   `done: false`, the park itself living in `board.db`. It is not ticked, and
   a phase that advanced with parked work says so in its section. A phase reported as complete when
   three of its criteria were skipped is exactly the lie this workflow exists to prevent — the aim
   is that skipping is *allowed and visible*, not that it is hidden.

   If the roadmap and the dashboard disagree because someone edited `ROADMAP.md` by hand, say so and
   ask. Never silently overwrite a phase status a person set.

9. **Confirm the agent's completions.** List every `task_status` row with `source = 'agent'`,
   `status = 'done'`, `confirmed_by IS NULL` and `rejected_at IS NULL` — a rejected one is never
   asked about again — with its note and commits, and ask the person
   (`AskUserQuestion`) to confirm or reject each. Confirm sets `confirmed_by` — the person's
   `assignee.id`; ask once which assignee they are, and add them to `assignee` if the table is empty
   — and `confirmed_at`. Reject sets `rejected_at` and puts the person's reason in `note`: the row stops
   applying, so the task falls back to its plan status, but it is kept. Deleting it would let the
   agent mark the same task done again from the same commits. This is the only writer of `confirmed_by`. Until confirmed, such a task
   reads as `done · unconfirmed`; once confirmed, `done · unverified`, like a person's own drag into
   Done. Either way it counts as not done until a verified criterion ticks it.
10. **Record the test trail.** Read whatever the test run produced — a JUnit or JSON reporter file,
   the runner's own output — and write each run into `board.db`'s `test_run` table, linked to a task
   by its reference id where the test names one, and to the epic otherwise.

   This is what makes a task's claim to be done inspectable: the drawer shows which runs covered it,
   when they ran, and whether they passed. A task marked done with no linked run is not a
   contradiction to hide — it is exactly the thing the Tests readiness gate is asking about, and it
   should read as unmet until a run exists.

   Never write a passing run that did not happen. If the reporter produced nothing, record nothing
   and say so.

11. **Recompute deployment readiness** — the seven gates in `references/git-hooks.md` — and write it
   into `PROGRESS.md` as a checklist. Report gates met over gates total, never a percentage.

### Install the project management agent

Create or refresh `.claude/agents/project-manager.md` — the agent that judges whether the project is
succeeding across idea, development, production, and maintenance, and keeps it moving toward
deployment, using `.idea/` and `.management/` as its evidence.

**If a `create-agent` skill is available, use it.** Otherwise write the definition directly:
frontmatter with `name`, a trigger-rich `description`, `tools`, and `model`.

Its write scope is deliberately narrow, and the definition must say so:

- **May** create epics at `status: suggested` in `.idea/epics/`, and set task status in
  `board.db` from commit evidence — the latter always carrying a note, the commit SHAs, and the PR
  where one exists, with `confirmed_by` left null for a person to confirm.
- **May not** edit `SPECS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, an accepted epic, an idea note, any `.management/`
  Markdown, or tick an acceptance criterion. It may not deploy, tag, or push.

Give it `Write` and no `Edit`, and say in the definition that `Write` is for new `status: suggested`
epics only — a subagent's tools cannot be scoped to one folder, so the definition is what holds
that line. Those two paths are the whole of its write access. Changing the plan
is `/shape` or `/epic`, regenerating state is `/setup`, shipping is `/ship`.

On a later run, update its description if the project's shape changed; never overwrite a definition
the user has edited without saying so first.

### Then, last of all, the dashboard

> [!important] The dashboard is built **after** the app, never alongside it
> It is the final thing `/setup` builds: after Phase 4 has executed and **Phase 5 has verified
> green**. That order is not tidiness, it is the whole reason the page looks like it belongs.
>
> The dashboard introduces no design of its own. It is assembled from the app's tokens, its
> components, its dark-mode mechanism, its router, its test runner and its build config. Build it
> before those exist and there is nothing to reuse, so it invents them — a second design system
> inside one repository, which the app then contradicts for every phase afterwards. That is the
> single most expensive mistake available here, because by the time anyone notices, both are load
> bearing.

**Do not start it while any of these is true.** Fix the app first and come back:

- install, lint, typecheck, test or build is failing;
- the target phase's exit criteria are unmet;
- `app/` is mid-scaffold, or the framework choice is still open;
- the performance budget was missed and not yet accepted.

A dashboard reporting on a project that does not build is furniture.

#### Audit the app before offering to build anything

Read what the app actually has, and **report the findings to the user in the question itself**. This
takes one pass and decides everything downstream — `references/management.md` has the full checklist
of what to look for and where.

At minimum, establish and name: the **theme tokens** and where they live · the **component library**,
if any, and whether it is shadcn · the **dark-mode mechanism** · the **spacing and radius scale** ·
the **router** · the **test runner** · whether a **drawer, sheet or dialog** already exists.

Two outcomes matter:

| Audit found | What it means |
|---|---|
| Tokens and components | Build against them. Every substitution goes in `.management/contract/tokens.map`, so a reviewer can see what was swapped for what |
| Neither — a bare Phase 0 skeleton | There is nothing to inherit. **Say so and offer to defer** |

#### The question

Use `AskUserQuestion`. Lead with the recommended option, and state the trade-off in one line — such
a route exposes the roadmap, blockers, unshipped plans, and team names to anyone who can reach it.

Say up front what it is: four sections behind a sidebar — Board, Specs, Team, Status — backed by a
standalone database. It is more than a status page, and it is a real build.

Offer: **dev-only (recommended)** · auth-gated in production · public · **defer to a later phase** ·
none.

> [!warning] When the app has no design system yet, lead with *defer*
> On a first run the app is a walking skeleton: a token file with four colours, no component
> library, maybe no dark mode. A dashboard built then has to invent a card, a badge, a drawer and a
> scale — and a later phase that adds the real ones inherits a page that matches none of them.
>
> Deferring costs nothing. `.management/` still gets its Markdown and `state.json`, so progress is
> tracked from day one; only the page waits. Say which phase to revisit it in — the one that
> introduces the app's own components — and record the deferral in the run report so the next
> `/setup` picks it up rather than forgetting it.
>
> If the user wants it now anyway, that is their call: build it, keep it plain rather than inventing
> a design system, and **say in the report that it will need revisiting** once the app has a theme.

#### Building it

Build only on a yes. **Read `.management/DESIGN.md` and the notes in `.management/design/` first** —
they are the spec, and they describe the dashboard as it was refined in use, not as it was first
sketched. Five of them are what make a rebuild land in the same place:

| Note | Fixes |
|---|---|
| `design/Reference Implementation.md` | Every measurement, breakpoint, and the epic colour algorithm |
| `design/Derivations.md` | Every derived number as portable pseudocode |
| `design/API Surface.md` | The operation set, and what `null` means in each write |
| `design/Copy Deck.md` | The exact words, including the ones that must not be softened |
| `design/Conformance.md` | How the result is **checked**, and what the check cannot prove |

**Appearance comes from the app** — its theme, its tokens, its components, its dark mode. Those
notes fix layout, behaviour and wording, not palette. Reach for the project's own component first;
where it has none, build it once in a `ui/` directory from the project's tokens. Snap to the
project's nearest scale step where it has a scale; use the literal values where it has nothing.

Check `design/Requirements.md` before starting: it needs a standalone database, and pull request
status needs the GitHub MCP. If either is missing, say so and build the part that works rather than
faking the rest.

Add no new dependencies beyond the one database driver, and apply the gate the user picked.

#### Before reporting it built

Two checks, in this order, and **report both**:

1. **Conformance.** Write `.management/contract/sources.txt` (including the server side) and
   `tokens.map`, write the derivation goldens from `.management/contract/fixtures/` (both the main set and
   `lifecycle/`) as tests in the
   project's own runner, then run them and:

   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/dashboard-conformance.sh
   ```

   These are mechanical. Do not report the dashboard built while either fails.

2. **The compliance checklist in `.management/DESIGN.md`**, walked item by item and reported as met
   over total, naming every item that is not. It is long because each line is something a build has
   actually got wrong. "It looks right" is not a check, and a rule that is never exercised is a rule
   the next build quietly drops.

If the project has no web surface — a CLI, a library — say so and offer the reference's fallback
instead: a self-contained `.management/dashboard.html` plus a `board` script that prints progress.

**On every later run, re-check a built dashboard.** If `.management/contract/sources.txt` lists
files, the dashboard exists: run its derivation goldens and `dashboard-conformance.sh` again, and
report both. A `/upgrade` can change `Derivations.md` or the contract while the code in `app/`
stays as it was; this is where the difference shows.

## Phase 7 — Record and hand off

- Append a dated entry to `## Setup log` in `SPECS.md`; set `status: active` and bump `updated`. Set
  `ROADMAP.md` to `status: active` too, on the first run: the plan is now being built.
- In `ROADMAP.md`, tick met exit criteria with their evidence. Set the phase `in-progress`, or
  `verified` once every criterion that does not need a live release is met — never `done`, which is
  `/ship`'s.
- **Tick each epic acceptance criterion this run verified**, with its evidence before the points,
  because the block reference must end the line:
  `- [x] Saves a doc — verified by save.test.ts, a1b2c3d (3 pts) ^tsk-7f3a21`.
  A confirmed agent completion is ticked only when this run verified it too — confirming is a
  person vouching for the agent's reading, not evidence. This includes work `/work-on` finished since the last run, which leaves `.idea/` alone and relies
  on this step to record it.
- Set the built epics to `done` or `in-progress`; bump their `updated`.
- Write an ADR for any decision you had to make that SPECS.md did not cover.
- Regenerate `INDEX.md`.
- Write or update `CLAUDE.md` with the stack, conventions, and the real commands to run. **Replace
  the block between `<!-- tateru:before-setup -->` and `<!-- /tateru:before-setup -->`** — the "No
  app exists yet" section, which stops being true now — with a `## Stack and commands` section: the
  stack, where the app lives, and the verified install, dev, lint, typecheck, test, focused-test and
  build commands. Leave the rest of the file as it is.
- **Write or refresh the stack profile** — `.claude/team/stack.md` and `.claude/team/checks.env` —
  per `.claude/skills/work-on/references/stack-profile.md`. It is what turns the `/work-on` agents
  into specialists of this stack, and what the `pre-push` hook runs. Only from commands Phase 5
  verified green; never a version the lockfile does not pin. Preserve a hand edit and say so.
- Refresh `.management/` so `BOARD.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `state.json` match what Phase 5 verified.

Close with: what was created and why · commands verified with their actual results · exit criteria
met vs. outstanding · anything deferred and why · where the `.management/` board now stands ·
commits ingested since the last run and the readiness gates still open · the exact next command to
run.
