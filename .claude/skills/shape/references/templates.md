# SPECS

> [!abstract] In one sentence
> What this is and who it is for.

## Identity

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | |
| One-liner | |
| Repo / package | |
| License | |

## Users and job

Who uses this and what job they hire it for. Derived from [[Theme]] notes.

## Success

The one metric that says it worked, and the number that counts as working.

## Scope — v1

- [[Epic A]]
- [[Epic B]]

## Non-goals

Named explicitly. Each with the reason it is out.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why | Alternatives considered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Language / runtime | | | |
| Framework | | | |
| Package manager | | | |
| Database | | | |
| Data access / migrations | | | |
| Auth | | | |
| Styling / UI | | | |
| Testing | | | |
| Lint / format / typecheck | | | |
| CI | | | |
| Hosting / deploy | | | |
| Secrets / env | | | |

Pin versions where the choice is version-sensitive. `setup` consumes this table literally.

## Data model sketch

```mermaid

  USER ||--o{ DOCUMENT : owns
```

Enough to start migrations, not a final schema.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | [[ADR-0001 ...]] |

## Open questions

> [!question]
> - ...

## Traceability

Which ideas became which epics: [[Idea A]] → [[Epic A]] → Phase 1.

## Setup log

Appended by `setup` after each run, dated.

# ROADMAP

> [!abstract] Shape of the plan
> N phases. The riskiest assumption is tested in Phase X.

| Phase | Goal | Exit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Walking skeleton | Deployed, CI green | planned |
| 1 | | | planned |

## Phase 0 — Walking skeleton

**Goal.** One sentence, an outcome.

**Epics.** [[Epic A]] · [[Epic B]]

**Exit criteria**
- [ ] Verifiable by someone who did not write it.

**Demo.** The sentence you say while screen-sharing.

> [!warning] Risks
> - Risk — and its early warning sign.

**Non-goals.** Named explicitly.

## Phase 1 — <Name>

Same shape. Repeat per phase.
